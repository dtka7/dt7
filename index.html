		<h1><u>Start of my coding journey</u></h1>
		<h2><em>January 11th, 2024</em></h2>
			<p> Here is where my journey started as a front-end/web designer. It all really started with a youtube video that went something like: <em>"How to become self-employed 
			and make 10k a month in 2024"</em> which in reality sounds like another youtuber that is trying to sell thier online 500 euro courses to some 15 year-olds kids. But it 
			really ended in an interesting way, there was a moment that explained the variations of income and one of them was web design. <br> There was also a very interesing 
			example of a persons journey in becoming a web-designer, which in a way did give me a sudden motiavtion to have another try.</p>
		<h2><em>January 12th to like Janurary 31th, idk, 2024 </em></h2>
			<p> After realising that choosing a career path as a front-end engineer was going to take 160 hours to complete each task became very tideous and alittle boring however
			my everyday 2hr small sessions really did help me to finish my first HTML course in I'd say something like 2 or 3 weeks which in retro spec is a shit load of time, was 
			cuz I did get alittle lazy on some of the weeks and did have a time off on my birthday to spend it with my familly and my girl.</p>
		<h2><em>Feburary 2nd, 2024 </em></h2>	
			<p> First website is formed. Yes the one you are looking at right now. That's crazy. Nearly a whole month to actually figure out how to create my own website. Tbh it was 
			kinda in the making for a long time and idk why today was this day, but yeah here it is. </p>

			<h2><em> February 3rd, 2024, 02:32am </em></h2>
				<p> 
						I know it's getting kinda late, cuz my brain feels all fuzzy and cooked. Although I did have a small 1.5h nap today I still feel dead inside from all the traing
					that German put me through. I can help it but I still want to work on this... this... idfk is this already some kinda gay ass diary book or a blog post who knows. 
					I'm certain that there is an easier way to write this blog post instead of actually writing it into the code like a noob. Anyways I'll try and figure it out tmr cuz
					I know the codeacademy exercise and the walk through I'm just to lazy to do it atm and muerto. 
				</p>
<!-- I know that there is a very easy way to do this-->
			<h3><em> 8:45am </em></h3>
				<p> 
						Just woke up. Couldn't really go to bed today at all cuz of the long ass nap, was thinking about how to implement the post option like in that movie about Facebook
					how in the first few scenes you see Mark posting blogs n shit. I find it cringe but also a little cool at the same time. Have an urge to make this blog post thingy on my
					website. Just to try really.
				</p>
			<h3><em> 9:19am </em></h3>
				<p> 
					Starting to work on the feature lets see if its as easy as it looks.
				</p>
			<h3><em> 10:59am </em></h3>
				<p> 		It wasn't easy...Tried to get the blog post feature working but didnt really succeed. I'm pretty sure i can make it work if I just ask chat gpt to also make a save script so that 
					everytime i post it would also save this file. Through scripts I'm sure that it would be much easier, however I do intend to make this more of a practice blog project 
					hopefully implement some of these new features to my main website that would be hosted on a server and hopefully look cooler than just some black and white text. Lastly,
					I kept on getting this error that showed the data twice when I used the JavaScript and couldnt figure out what it was, so in the end I put all my code into gpt and found
					there was an extra set of body and head tags that were straight bugging me for 30 or so minutes.
				</p>
			<h3><em> 8:23pm </em></h3>
				<p> 
						I've started to work again on some CSS codeacademy excercises and starting to feel a little more confortable with how to edit each section and design it my own way. Also my front-end 
					course percentage is at 7% right now. So I'll keep working on these excercises untill I get bored and call my honeyyyy. Today we are watching Baby Driver which I'm looking forward to. The
					movie is goated and I'm sure she'll love it. In total I did more or less 1 hour of trying to get a blog post thing done which I eddited it as a comment to tweak and prefect later on when I
					will have a little more practice and start to familirize on how this shit works. 
				</p>
			<h2><em> February 4th, 2024, 2:27pm </em></h2>
				<p> So I knwo I started pretty late today but I'll try and make it up by completing the Fundementals of CSS part, which would be around 3-4 hours of work and will have a shot at using it 
					here on this website.</p>
				<h3><em> 8:56pm </em></h3>
				<p> 
					Worked on the CSS lessons for around 2 hours, probably will do sm more in the next hour or so. Seems easy just have to practice on it more and yeah some more creativity probably... 
				</p>
			<h2><em> February 7th, 2024, 9:00pm </em></h2>
				<p> 
						So I had a little break for coding just was busy doing other things and trying to find some job to be able to become more independent and stuff, but it got boring today so I decided to do
					some coding. Would normally go to the gym around this time but I'm not really in the mood to go. Funnly enough I have come to realise that I usually go to the gym when I stay at my mums since
					its usually more problematic living with her so it kinda gives me the motivation to go there. And the drive also motivates me to just clear it. Idk. Still trying to finish with CSS so lets see
					how it goes.
				</p>
			<h3><em> 9:28pm </em></h3>
				<p> 
						Had a small practice session cuz I kinda forgot how to use the display and positioning elements like the differnce between inline-block, block and inline. Also the z-index and the various
					positioning. Also the flow it the verb the codeacademy uses to explain that is how the user interacts with the website which is interesting, I didn't know that. Finished the quiz just now 
					strating the project now. I think its the final one.
				</p>
			<h2><em> February 12th, 2024, 12:53am 10%</em></h2>
				<p> 
						Ok so I haven't really been updating my progress here because I made another website using the codeacademy video tutorial as a reference. I've started to understand more and am going to
					try and complete the next project without too much cheating and copying and see how it will go. Although I will be using the template of how to put images and correctly size them from my
					other projects.
				</p>
				<h3><em> 3:33pm, 11%</em></h3>
				<p>
						I just finished uploading the website through Github and now would mark the first day and time id release anything on the internet. Crazy...... 
				</p>
				<h2><em> February 13th, 2024, 12:46pm 13%</em></h2>
				<p> 
						Did my highest percentage in 24hrs. Nlg it starting to get more and more understanding and enjoyable, i guess... Anyways will do the 2 assignments tomorrow so lets see how they go.
				</p>
				<h3><em> 6:51pm, 13%</em></h3>
				<p>
						Completed my first 2 assignments (1st-76%, 2nd-100%) while I was waiting for my sister. Although I can lie I did use some heplp from gpt when doing work on the addition of tables. 
					So realisticly it would be something like 72 and 84. But anyways ill probably repeat it tomorrow with zero help and see how ill do. Talked to my mum today nothing new really. She said 
					she missed us. Also got alittle mad at my sister for licking and putting her face on the glass of my x-5 and now she refuses to clean it. Probably my everyone is either mad at me or saying
					im being bitchy... Need some silence.
				</p>
				<h2><em> February 15th, 2024, 10:53pm 14%</em></h2>
				<p>
						Today I have kept working on improving CSS styling and am slowly getting to 15%. I have also made my mind up that after my trip to London I will decide whether I will stay on my lifes
					path of becoming an engineer how I always said that I will be one day. Or try to become a programmer and live in my life of code and try to make a living of that. In both ways I will be sure
					that the decision that I'll make will be the right one. I'll talk about my thoughts more tmr in the plane.....
				</p>
				<h2>February 16th, 2024, 12:10am 14%</h2>
				<p> 
						I've started to work on the CSS aspect of this page and just experimenting with what I can do and can't. I am a little stuck on the positioning aspect of some of the elements. I have at
						it later. I'll also have plenty of time today to go through all projects on CA and use them in my CSS file cuz thats what I'm thinking of doing. And also I should probably not forget to
						upload all the stuff.

<!-- ok so this is the first some what of an attempt to try and make my own website blog post which didn't really work out since I don't have a server yet so it wouldn't save 
		and there for be implemented to your code. Even though I'm sure there is a way to automatically upload it to your code without using javascripts I'll keep it in mind and slowly 
		work on it to see if I get lucky and accidently find the solution to my unclear question. Also code below was the attempt.

			<h1>The Plan <em><strong>(Obviously On-going)</strong></em></h1>
			<h2><em> LEARN THE CODE </em></h2>
				<p>- First of the main priority is to fully learn how to use HTML and how to manipulate it into doing what you want. Then and only then you can move on and do other exercises
				like the ones for CCS and shit like that. So yeah, plan for tmr and the close coming future is to make a post/blog with time and date system that can record all these plans 
				and blog shits easily. <br>
				- Learn how to implement a blog post feature to then later on be able to add a comment section or idk a reaction section. This would also probably invole learning scripts
				and how to manipulate them to do want you want them to and not have to go back and forth on chat gpt telling that poor ai its doing it all wrong.</p>
